## Getting Started

Graphig is now re compiled and will be improved in the next days.


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`:     the folder to maintain sources
- `docs`:    the folder to save information and help
- `samples`: the folder to get initial examples
- `icons`:   the folder to store images and icons

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Compile and Use

`javac --source-path src/ -d bin src/main/GrapherMain.java`

`java -cp bin main.GrapherMain`
